# Reflection

When I first entered this class, I was a tad bit nervous. After all, I never really liked programming. Turns out, I just hated Java more than anything. Either way, JavaScript is indeed different, and with a teacher who had passion and would teach in a way that did work for me, I feel like I preferred JavaScript over just plain old Java (why are they called similarly if they are different).

Even if I hold a love hate relationship with programming, I’ll admit the inner cheer I have when my code *finally* works. The anguish and pain I get when a code doesn’t work might bring me only misery, but the victory I have when the code finally works prevails all. 
---
The most challenging of programming is, everything. The only part I never struggled with was bringing in the canvas and creating it. The way that one must be sure to write everything perfectly because if it isn’t written the way that the program likes it, it will just completely break everything and not work. Worse times are when it’s not working but then the console shows that everything is fine (it’s not!!!).

On a different note, my most beloved and proudest work must be the music/noise assignment. It’s my baby and I adore it. I made it using the same “engine” as I had on my first project but just slightly better. I also adored the story and characters. Even when I had challenges on my code breaking, I would be able to fix it in record time which only brought me so much joy. I worked way too hard on it so I’m in love with it.

Finally, I believe I have gotten better from my first ever works on this class. The first exercises I didn’t know what I was doing and always had to check back on the lessons or my old code to even have an idea on what to do next. I was always at a loss on what to do. But I am proud to say that now I can write down some things without looking at the lessons. Still, I have a lot to learn, and I know this, but I’m proud that I managed to get to a point where at a time back then that I hated programming, now it’s not too bad.

I believe that in the future, I’ll be able to create more games, and hopefully, something that’s beautiful and functional. I love visual novels and hope to be able to make a full-fledged visual novel in p5 that looks more like a visual novel and not have the messiest code in all of mankind. Maybe also in the future, I will be able to organize my code better (…and comment better).
